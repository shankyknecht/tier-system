# How to set this up

1 - First you will need Python and Pip on your system (google it, there's a ton of info about this)
2 - Run the command on your terminal `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3 - create a `.env` file with the following content(replace whatever is inside []):
```.env
BOT_TOKEN=[YOUR BOT TOKEN]
GUILD_ID=[YOUR SERVER ID]
ROLE_ID=[THE STAFF ROLE ID]
```
(SERVER ID and STAFF ROLE ID are also pretty easy to get, just google it, takes seconds xD)
4 - run the bot with `python main.ppy`
5 - It should be up and running, if not contact Gabulhas#7229
